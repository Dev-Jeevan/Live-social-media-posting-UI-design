# Live-social-media-posting-UI-design

Designed a user interface using flask for tweeting/posting on identifed social media platforms and storage of such tweets/post in cloud database


(1) Aquired developer account for both twitter and Reddit.

(2) Developed a back-end using python code to connect and access the developer accounts.

(3) With the use of flask, created a front-end to update user tweets/posts in twitter & Reddit.

(4) Posted live tweets/posts to both twitter and Reddit user accounts using the the UI.

(5) Stored the live tweets & posts in the mongo db.

In this project, i managed to post live tweets / posts and updated them in the live cloud database without using the social media accounts with the use of the platform that i have developed.
